# Remote-Pending-Activites
These are activities that were completed during my Pending (Work-obligation) and Remote Sessions

Used API Keys to go through CNNews and other twitter accounts to grab specific tweets and loop through those tweets to run Vader Analysis. Created script to hold sentiments, (i.e., neutral, negative, positive, and compound).
Other methods used were used to print and post quotes in twitter accounts in the QuoteBot activity and setting timers between each pull.
