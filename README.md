# Remote-Pending-Activites
These are activities that were completed during my Pending (Work-obligation) and Remote Sessions

For Javascript II and III - leanred how to utlize both css and js file within a html file using functions and tags. Mostly used the 'for Each' function and placing data within an html table tag ('td', 'tr') using tbdoy.append.
Struggled a bit of using d3.select to input elements. Used 'reversedString' to set the output text to the reversed input string. Used how to attach a clickHandler to a variable.

For Twitter and Social Media Assignments - I have created ReadME files within each of those folders for your review.
